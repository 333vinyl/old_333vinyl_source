  "bio": "I’m Noah Simon, and I’ll be writing for 333vinyl every once in a while. I share a lot of musical preferences with Ben, although I spend a lot of my listening hours with older musical touchstones from throughout pop history - but I stay involved with what’s going on today. Some of my favorite artists/groups are LCD Soundsystem, Captain Beefheart and His Magic Band, Aphex Twin, My Bloody Valentine, The Residents, and Burial. Electronic music really fascinates me, especially when it’s approached in singular or unconventional ways. I’m also interested in “academic,” “classical,” or “old person” music - whatever you want to call it. Beethoven’s late quartets are stand-outs for me, and I love 20th century music, especially 12-tone music and musique concrete.",
