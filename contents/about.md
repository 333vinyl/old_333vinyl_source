333vinyl is a new music site started by [Ben Bailey][1] with a lot of help from his friends. He likes music and writing, and thought he should probably combine the two.

All scores are on a five-point scale.

Feel free to [contact Ben](mailto:bennettbailey@gmail.com) if you're interested in contributing.

This site was built with Wintersmith and is open source. You can view the code for the site [here][2].
