333vinyl is a new music site started by [Ben Bailey][1] with the help of [his friends](http://333vinyl.us/authors). He likes music and writing, and thought he should probably combine the two. The site is in progress right now as it begins to take shape, but for now check out the reviews that have been posted.

All scores are on a five-point scale.

Feel free to [contact me](mailto:bennettbailey@gmail.com) if you're interested in contributing.

This site was built with Wintersmith and is open source. You can view the code for the site [here][2].
