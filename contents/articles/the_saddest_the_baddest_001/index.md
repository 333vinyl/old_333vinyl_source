I'm Sophie from Whidbey Island in Washington State and I like to pretend I know what's cool. My music taste is pretty broad so I won't go into detail, but I will say I like Dave Matthews Band in a very un-ironic way. Here's what to listen to while smoking, painting nails, and driving home at 5 AM.

```
Artist: The War On Drugs
Song: Red Eyes
Album: Lost In The Dream
Label: Secretly Canadian
```

Red Eyes is the breakout song from what I might call one of the best albums of the year so far from Philadelphia’s The War On Drugs. Solely written by vocalist Adam Grandciel after a heartbreak, Lost In the Dream is expansive, lofty and filled with desire and melancholic beauty. Red Eyes is reminiscent of Springsteen craftsmanship: passion fueled vocal bursts and shouts, jangling piano chords, grinding crescendo leading to the chorus. The song signifies the end of a relationship, but it remains resiliently optimistic and almost elated. “I can see it in the darkness coming my way... Well we’re here” concludes Grandciel, the relationship at it’s close, as the song triumphantly rings out into the night; the soundtrack to a drive through the desert of self discovery.

Artist: The Radio Dept.
Song: Heaven’s On Fire
Album: Clinging To A Scheme
Label: Labrador
```

The Swedish electro-pop trio’s most popular release is their most unusual record, and probably their most satirical. The track opens with a segment from Sonic Youth frontman Thurston Moore, who so boldly decries pop culture, capitalism, and even calls the youth to action to destroy this “bogus” society. And yet, through Moore’s last statements can be heard the openings of The Radio Dept.’s bubbling, frothy pink pop song almost mockingly piercing with their sweetness the sentiments of the political statement. It is the bands one and only take on a modern pop anthem, complete with the line “One look at you, and heaven’s on fire” breathed out into the waves and jingles of the track; a playful love song contrasted only by the opening statements. This song is summer in the the most innocent and quintessential means possible, yet the irony of singer Johan Ducanson’s counter phrase “One look at you, and hell’s on fire” and Thurston Moore’s opening interview leave the foaming keyboard barbed with hilarity.

```
Artist: Mac DeMarco
Song: Ode To Viceroy
Album: 2
Label: Captured Tracks
```

Mac DeMarco is your typical stoner/slacker friend. Plaid shirt, scruffy smirk on his wide mouthed smile, and the inability to actually like anything in his life without a hint of sarcasm. However, this love song to DeMarco’s smoke of choice is the most un-ironic sentimentality you will hear from him. “Oh honey, I’ll smoke you ’til I’m dying” sighs DeMarco, as he coos over his beloved destruction, as his guitar soars sharply into the suburban night, or at the corner store “already running dry” or as the evening starts to dim the sky. DeMarco swears eternal faithfulness as he tenderly strums out his promises over the drums, never faltering, just like his love.

```
Artist: Lana Del Rey
Song: Sad Girl
Album: Ultraviolence
Label: Polydor, Interscope
```

Ah, yes. No reference to teenage angst would be complete without a little Lana. Really, the entirety of Del Rey’s Ultraviolence could be on this list. The album is really not too different from 2012’s Born To Die, and although the hip hop influences from her earlier work are replaced with Dan Auberbach’s (The Black Keys) spaced out guitar solos and jazz effects, Del Rey still is heartbroken, struggling to achieve the irresistible American Dream, and setting out to prove once again that she’s not like “the other girls”. And although these themes are getting quite annoying, every single track on the album is stunning. But Sad Girl is Del Rey’s theme, filled to the top with rage repressed into beautiful longing, lovers who cannot be loved, floating vocals, and all the cinematic accompaniment that can be met with Del Rey’s whining “I’m a sad girl, a bad girl”. She’ll go to her grave defending her man even though his “bonnie on the side” makes her a sad, sad girl, and you just wouldn’t understand. Yet millions of pimpled faced adolescents who haven’t even moved out of the house still croon her ballads. This is perfection.
