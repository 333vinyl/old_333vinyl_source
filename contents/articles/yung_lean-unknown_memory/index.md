`Used to be a hobby now it’s all I think about // That’s what rap does`

Yung Lean is undeniably interesting. He first garnered attention with ["Ginseng Strip 2002"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrQWhFysPKY) and ["Hurt"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stgrSjynPKs), and while he came off as a goofy swede adopting esoteric internet culture, he was-in the purest form-just a young hip-hop fan. He was an avid listener who, freed from any American preconceptions about rap and lucky enough to be around some incredibly musical producers, just went for it. It worked: they made a great project, established a ravenous fanbase, and garnered internet-wide attention. Lean clearly found his calling and realized he wanted to eschew any association with so-called "meme rap."

So he released ["Kyoto"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMgkt9jdjTU), a song that caught doubters off-gaurd. To many, the song still seemed ridiculous, his rapping terrible, and the video over-the-top silly, but to those who had seen "Hurt" saw the metamorphosis. Unknown Memory is the product of this change, the creation of a Yung Lean who unexpectedly became a full-fledged rap star; complete with a sold-out tour.

Gone are many of the nonsensical lines and perpetual non-sequiturs. Yung Lean replaces them with confidence, introspective musings, and braggadocio that–while it was seen as comedic in past work–in many cases can now be assumed true. This is what a lot of the disappointment and negative reactions stem from. Making the switch from quasi-joke rapper to post quasi-joke rapper with more serious songs puts him in limbo–should be compared with traditional rappers? Or should he be lumped with the rappers who get a handicap for being a “meme”? Yung Lean is transitioning, what some could even posture as artistic growth. Shedding mumbling for an auto-tune drawl a la Future does him favors in furthering his confidence, and complements the production fantastically. And that is what Lean is all about, he is yet another instrument to the Yung Gud or the Yung Sherman band which backs him up. In tracks like “Yoshi City” and “Ghosttown” Lean seems most formidable, and these are easily the most “Kyoto”-esque in terms of accessibility. “Ice Cold Smoke” is the most auto-tuned, but with slow skittering hats, a short time stamp, and a fantastic beat switch, it is digestible. Lean succeeds again with infectious choruses–I catch myself singing “Don’t Go” and “Blinded” at various points during the day. However, in songs like “Sandman” and “Volt” the beats are overly busy, and Lean’s raps do not mesh. The instrumental tracks also did nothing but annoy me, and the only purpose I could see them serving would be to either provide a break from Lean’s voice or to jar the listener in preparation for his unorthodox sound. That being said, I liked a good amount of tracks on this album, thought it was a decent project overall, and I appreciate his development. There are a few tracks that will definitely go in rotation for the long term. The over-the-top nature of his previous project, Unknown Death, is lost in Unknown Memory and while it has positive implications, the album lacks some of that original charm by ironically being believable.

Yung Lean has merit. If you don’t like the rapping or the production, at least appreciate the new concepts of hip-hop he has to bring the the table, the culture that he has appropriated and fashioned into a cult, or simply that he is doing his thing as an 18 year old non-native speaker. This cult of "sadboys" may be doing him no favors in the way that Lil B’s #taskforce annoys the hell out of casual listeners, but he is another interesting case of niche hip-hop and internet fame.
