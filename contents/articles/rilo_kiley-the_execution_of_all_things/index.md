Hi, I’m Sara and I will be contributing to 333vinyl. My taste includes the foundation of indie rock central to the site in addition to special detail to female vocalists and experimental alternative rock.

Depression is a strange thing. It influences your capacity to create, so creative people tend to go through periods of inactivity. With its terror comes a common ground that all people with depression can fall back upon. This foundation is exemplified in Rilo Kiley’s sophomore album, *The Execution of All Things*.

Having loss and regret at the forefront of this album made it easy to connect to during one of my own episodes. The opening track, “The Good That Won’t Come Out”, tugs on the bottom of your coat until you’re forced to listen to what it has to say. Right away, vocalist Jenny Lewis attempts to make a connection with the listener: “let’s get together and talk about the modern age.” A desire to stray from stagnation makes its appearance through the album, along with Lewis and co-vocalist Blake Sennett’s personal experiences with depression.

> “You say I choose sadness, that it never once has chosen me. Maybe you’re right.” (“The Good That Won’t Come Out”)

Musically, *The Execution of All Things* is of the standard indie pop rock fare that made its rounds in the early 2000s. It is less inspired by country rock compared to their previous efforts, more so matching the Omaha Sound referenced in the title track “The Execution of All Things”. After all, the record was released off of Saddle Creek Records, founded by Bright Eyes’ frontman Conor Oberst. However, *The Execution of All Things* does continue down the established path of its predecessor by incorporating electronic sounds—not quite the MIDI-like interludes of *Take Offs and Landings*, but like the introduction to the title track, an anticipatory build to the reflective prose within. Its frank delivery of lyrics is what makes the album truly unique and what increased their recognition in the scene with their next album, *More Adventurous*.

However, similar to the “Variations on a Theme” interludes from their first album, pieces of a song appear throughout the album after “So Long”, “My Slumbering Heart”, and “Spectacular Views”. This song delivered in three parts is named by its last lyric, “And That’s How I Choose to Remember It”. The song is an exposition on the divorce of Lewis’ parents and her childhood that perfectly strings together the album’s motifs and adds to its overall cohesiveness.

Lewis was undoubtedly the face of the band (which broke up in 2011); however, there are still two tracks with vocals by Sennett on the album. The stronger of the two is “Three Hopeful Thoughts”, a hard rocking song about the removal of someone from one’s life. There are many goodbyes on this album: to parents, to lovers, to parts of one’s self. The kind of goodbye explored on this song is one that the author is in control of and actively wants, a contrast to the others present. This gives the song and subsequently the album a different kind of hope: a hope that acknowledges the pain of the past but also focuses on the opportunities of the future.

The stand-out track on an album filled with poignant insights is also its biggest hit, “A Better Son/Daughter”. It turns the themes of the album to max volume at the most important moment, guiding the listener through the portion of a depressive episode where one realizes they will have to fight and make it through the fog, reminding them that the good may be gone for now but it can still come out of them. *The Execution of All Things* is an essential part of Rilo Kiley’s catalog and a quintessential indie-rock representation of grief.
